# Changelog

## [2026-09-28]

### Added
- **Layer rules for the shell surfaces** (`config/hypr/layers.lua`): `blur = true` + `ignore_alpha` for the Quickshell namespaces (`qs-master`, the bar, floating overlay, notifications, desktop widgets), enabling the glassmorphism backdrop blur. Loaded from `hyprland.lua` after the window rules.
- **Window border gradients in `colors.lua`**: optional two-stop gradient per border (`borderGradientActive/Inactive`, `borderActive2/Inactive2`, `borderAngle*`) built with the 0.56 Lua table format, falling back to the palette accent/muted colors like the shell does.
- **`default_settings.json`**: `shadows` (host-drawn popup/bar shadows) and `glass` (translucent backgrounds) sections.

### Changed
- `hyprland.lua` requires the new `layers` module.

## [2026-09-10]

### Added
- **Unified Settings panel** (`bar-editor`, `SUPER+SHIFT+D`): sidebar rail with grouped pages, animated highlight, global search (`/`), `activeMode` deep-linking and lazy-loaded pages. Replaces the legacy settings sidebar and the inline dock editor; `SUPER+X` opens it on the About page.
- **Configurable app launcher** (`launcher` settings key): position (center/top/bottom/left/right) with real screen anchoring and directional intro, width, visible apps, row height, content alignment (left/center/right), icon visibility, margin (negative allowed), border width/color/radius and bar-overlap avoidance.
- **New Settings pages**: Hyprland window effects (same knobs as `SUPER+SHIFT+B`), Animations (enabled + speed), Input (sensitivity/accel/touchpad), Idle (auto/awake), GPU (Optimus modes), Notifications (Do Not Disturb) and an embedded About/Guide page.
- **Monthly dotfiles updater**: `scripts/dotfiles-update.sh` + systemd user timer; one `git fetch` per month against `origin/main`, `--ff-only` auto-pull only on a clean main, notification + green bar indicator when updates are available, and a remote-version fallback when there is no clone.
- **Version manifest** (`updates.json`) with `version`, `date` and `changelog`; the updater popup (`SUPER+U`) compares it with the installed version and shows the changelog (cached, at most one network check per month).
- **Starship integration** in the installer (package + xscriptor themes) and a fixed active `~/.config/starship.toml` that follows the palette live.

### Changed
- **Versioning standardized to xshell v1.0.0**: `install.sh` (`INSTALL_VERSION`), `updates.json` and the About panel now report 1.0.0.
- Settings tabs extracted from `SettingsPopup.qml` into shared `settings/tabs/*.qml`; the legacy sidebar was removed and its entry points (`SUPER+SHIFT+S`, bar settings button, guide) now open the unified panel.
- Starship themes are regenerated from a canonical template (fixes the self-destructive generator that emptied all themes); custom `STARSHIP_CONFIG` values are preserved.

### Fixed
- Editor pages no longer leave color bindings dead (black text) when `bar` was injected after construction (lazy Loader gate + qualified references).
- The bar no longer shifts when opening the settings panel (removed the old edge-offset animation).
- Monitors poller, startup/keybind models and the launcher palette editor now populate correctly inside the panel.


## [2026-09-05]

### Added
- **Second, switchable bar engine** (`barEngine: "dock" | "serp"` in `settings.json`): a classic left/center/right bar with modular/solid/fill styles, width %, thickness, opacity, autohide with edge tab, groups of modules, distinct pills, corner roundness and time-format options. Both engines share the same module catalog, data plumbing and palette; switching is hot (no full reload) and each engine keeps its own configuration.
- **Engine editor cards** — the Dock Editor now has an Engine switch (Dock ⇄ classic) and, per engine, its own cards: zones keep position/palette/appearance/window borders/zones; the classic engine gets position, style & size (distinct pills, roundness, thickness, opacity, width, autohide + delay), module sections with drag & drop between Left/Center/Right/Available (incl. groups and ungroup), mirror-from-dock layout, plus a shared palette picker.
- **Desktop widgets** — floating, palette-themable widgets (clock analog/digital/minimal, weather, music, audio visualizer, image) on the desktop, each monitor with its own persisted layout (`~/.local/state/quickshell/widgets/<monitor>/layout.json`), edited by a full-screen widget editor (`SUPER+SHIFT+W`): add, move, resize, rotate, opacity, variant, delete, duplicate, snapping and an image gallery.
- **Live palette editor** — edit the active palette's base-16 colors + background/foreground from the Dock Editor; applies live to the bar, desktop widgets, window borders and synced terminal themes, with a session snapshot & Reset.
- **New dock islands** — `weather` (current conditions, opens the calendar) and `focus` (focused window title); both arrive disabled by default and never alter existing layouts.
- **Live island drag & drop** on the bar: grab an island to reorder it between zones; commit is atomic, Esc/outside cancels; `dock.dragModules` toggle.
- **Per-zone container backgrounds** ("capsule in a capsule"): a themed translucent or solid rounded panel behind a zone's islands (roles + Solid toggle per zone), with per-island centering so mixed-height islands stay aligned.
- **Empty-workspace markers** in the workspaces pill: numbers / dots / letters / a custom Unicode character (e.g. Japanese glyphs) for empty workspaces; occupied ones keep app icons.
- **Per-palette workspace accent**: palettes can set a `workspaceActive` role for the active-workspace fill (theme `x`: gold; `berlin`/`london`: gray; `madrid`/`helsinki`: dark gold; others fall back to the default accent).
- **Bar opacity**, configurable clock formats, thickness/roundness knobs for the classic engine.

### Changed
- Settings hot-reload is now process-free and reliable: file watchers were replaced by native file watching (`FileView`) and polling timers, so every editor change applies live and reloads no longer leak watcher processes (previously ~980 orphan processes after repeated reloads exhausted system limits).
- Bar position/orientation changes remount the content in-process instead of reloading the whole shell.
- The updater manifest key was renamed `videos` → `releases` (the reader keeps a fallback for older manifests).

### Fixed
- Qt6 validation-type naming in the palette editor broke opening the Dock Editor — corrected.
- The classic bar rendered at zero size (root not following its container) — fixed; its widget redactor no longer duplicates lifecycle handlers.
- The workspace-marker setting was read from the wrong settings path and never applied — fixed.
- Empty/corrupt desktop-widget layouts are backed up and reset instead of blocking startup.
- Bluetooth scan sessions from the network popup no longer leak resident processes when the popup is toggled repeatedly.
- Mixed-height islands in a zone are now vertically aligned instead of top-aligned.

## [2026-09-02]

### Added
- **`scripts/restore-monitors.sh`** — authoritative layout restorer/reconciler (started from `autostart.lua`): applies the saved layout at session start and re-checks every ~2s, re-applying any monitor that drifts (late-enumerating dock outputs, unplug/re-plug, stray `hyprctl reload`s). Because every tool that changes monitors re-persists the layout, it converges instead of fighting.
- **`scripts/idle-mode.sh`** — idle control (awake/normal/boot/status): "awake" stops `hypridle` so nothing ever auto-dims/locks/suspends; the choice persists in `idle-settings.json` and `autostart.lua` honors it on every login.
- **Idle & sleep popup** — new QuickShell widget (`quickshell/idle/IdlePopup.qml`, SUPER+P): switch between Keep awake / Auto, plus Lock now and Suspend buttons. Manual lock stays SUPER+L, manual suspend SUPER+CTRL+L.
- **PAM service for the lock screen** — `config/pam.d/quickshell` (system-auth based) installed by `install.sh` and restored/removed by `uninstall.sh`. Without it, `PamContext` falls back to `pam_deny` and the session can never be unlocked (had to reboot every time the screen locked).
- **`scripts/persist-display-config.sh`** — single source of truth for `~/.config/hypr/display-config`; used by `monitor-manager.sh`, `scale-menu.sh` and QuickShell `Config.qml`.
- **Settings popup Monitors tab** — "Apply & save permanently" and "Reset to auto" buttons (the latter deletes the saved layout and returns to wildcard auto-arrangement).

### Changed
- **Saved monitor layouts are keyed by EDID description** (`desc|x|y|scale|mode`), not connector name: a physical screen keeps its position/scale/refresh even when the kernel renames its output (`DP-5` → `DP-3`), and one user's layout can never affect someone else's hardware (inert on non-matching screens).
- **Exact Hyprland modes are persisted and restored** (e.g. `1920x1080@144.11Hz`): `preferred` / `preferred@<int>` silently fell back to the EDID 60Hz mode.
- **`monitors.lua`** now only keeps the wildcard `highrr` entry — file reads during Lua config parse proved unreliable (rules silently never fired), so layout restoration moved entirely to `restore-monitors.sh`.
- **`workspaces.lua`** — workspaces 1-4 pinned to the author's physical screens by EDID description (laptop = 1, leftwards 2-4), each as that monitor's default so every screen boots to its own number.

### Fixed
- Multi-monitor setups resetting to "auto" (or only some monitors coming up) after reboot / config reload.
- Saved layouts keyed by connector name being dropped when dock outputs were renamed between boots.
- Refresh rate silently dropping to 60Hz when re-applying a layout or using the monitor-manager's rate menu.

## [2026-08-30]

### Added
- **Palette system** — 12 fixed palettes in `dock/palettes/*.json` + `dock/Colors.qml` (replaces `MatugenColors`). Every widget, border, SDDM, kitty and nvim now follows the active palette.
- **Window borders UI** — Dock Editor "Window borders" card (follow-palette toggle + manual active/inactive colors), applied live via `hyprctl eval` without restarting windows.
- **`scripts/theme-sync.sh`** — kitty + starship + VS Code themes regenerate from `dock/palettes` (single source of truth) and follow `settings.json → dock.palette` (VS Code updates `workbench.colorTheme` + `workbench.iconTheme` live, both `code` and `code-insiders`); nvim regenerates its palette data from `dock/palettes` (config/plugins stay from the user's repo).
- **`scripts/sddm-colors.sh`** — SDDM login theme colors derived from the palette, plus a dynamic background that follows the current wallpaper.

### Changed
- **Matugen removed** entirely: `MatugenColors.qml`, `qs_colors.json`, `matugen-apply.sh`, `matugen_reload.sh`, `matugen-colors.lua`, `config/matugen`, `install.sh`/`init.sh` matugen blocks.
- **All widgets migrated** to the palette (Blocks 1–3): bar modules, volume, network, battery, applauncher, calendar, settings, music, clipboard, system-monitor, quicknotes, rss-reader, file-search, scale, updater, guide, focustime, window-controls, Floating, Lock, ScreenshotOverlay, notifications.
- **Window borders** now derive from the active palette in `colors.lua` (reads `settings.json` + palette JSON).
- **SDDM theme** renamed `matugen-minimal` → `x`, palette-driven colors, adaptive dark/light overlay, background points at the live wallpaper cache.
- **kitty + nvim** installed from remote repos (`xscriptor-colors/terminal`, `xscriptor-colors/nvim`); bundled copies removed.
- **Removed widgets** `movies` (SUPER+P) and `stewart` (SUPER+X).
- **Removed legacy** `TopBar.qml`, `themes/*.conf`, `references.md`.

### Fixed
- Settings popup sidebar not drawing after topbar dead-code cleanup (brace imbalance) + missing `overlay1`/`overlay2` roles.
- Wallpaper picker applying from the wrong directory (`srcDir` now from `settings.json`).
- Kitty comment lines invisible: `color8` was too close to the background in several palettes (and `paris` had `color7` = background) — `color8` is now a mid-tone `mix(background, foreground, 0.5/0.65)` with sufficient contrast in all 12 palettes; `paris` `color7` fixed to the foreground.
- Shell comments (`# ...`) invisible when typed in zsh: `zsh-syntax-highlighting` defaults to `fg=black` (the background) — `~/.zshrc` now sets `ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES[comment]='fg=bright-black,bold'` so comments use the palette's `color8` (visible in every theme).
- Notifications popup: removed decorative background bubbles; kept small/minimal on the side; removed the redundant `swaync` daemon (double popup + broken app icon).
- Screen recorder: `gpu-screen-recorder -w portal` hung without saving; switched to direct capture (`-w screen` full, `-w region` area) and converted the overlay's grim-style geometry (`X,Y WxH`) to gsr's (`WxH+X+Y`) so area recordings save correctly.
- Guide info panel: removed the obsolete "Matugen" tab (now "Palettes") and the "Modules" tab/button, fixed the author block typo (`xscripto` → `xscriptor`), branding `Imperative` → `xshell`, version state renamed `imperative-dots-version` → `xshell-version` (written by the installer), repo links fixed to `main` branch and correct targets (NixOS→xlnux, Wallpapers→xww), and slightly more compact window (1160×720) keeping all color roles.
- Various pre-existing QML bugs: widget property injection (`Main.qml`), QuickNotes autosave, FileSearch `surface2`, Guide/Clipboard/appLauncher/Calendar transform scoping, NetworkPopup scoping, Updater null guard, Zone reload noise.

## [2026-08-23]

- Migrate all customizations to xscriptor-colors

## [2026-08-12]

### Added
- Migrated the Hyprland config from hyprlang to the Lua format (Hyprland 0.55+): `hyprland.lua` entry point plus `env.lua`, `colors.lua`, `variables.lua`, `settings.lua`, `monitors.lua`, `keybinds.lua`, `animations.lua`, `windowrules.lua`, `workspaces.lua` and `autostart.lua`.
- `config/matugen/scheme` -- configurable Matugen color scheme (defaults to `scheme-fruit-salad` for celeste tones instead of the default blue).
- `config/hypr/scripts/quickshell/wallpaper/matugen-apply.sh` -- central helper that runs Matugen with the configured scheme; used by the wallpaper picker, init and installer.
- `config/matugen/templates/hyprland.lua.template` -- regenerates dynamic window border colors from the wallpaper into `matugen-colors.lua`, consumed by `colors.lua` with a fallback to the fixed X palette.

### Changed
- Removed the dynamic config generator (`settings_watcher.sh`, `detect-monitors.sh`, `templates/`) and all legacy `.conf` files. `monitors.lua` auto-detects monitors at the highest refresh rate via `mode = "highrr"`.
- `scripts/monitor-manager.sh` and `scripts/scale-menu.sh` -- now apply monitors via `hyprctl eval 'hl.monitor(...)'` (the old `hyprctl keyword monitor` no longer exists).
- `scripts/quickshell/window-controls/persist.sh` -- writes `config/window-effects.lua` and `config/gaps.lua` instead of `.conf`; `WindowControls.qml` no longer uses `hyprctl keyword`.
- `scripts/quickshell/Config.qml` -- `applyMonitors()` uses the Lua API so refresh rate changes from the settings panel actually apply; `saveAllKeybinds()` and `saveAllStartup()` now write `config/user-keybinds.lua` / `config/user-startup.lua` (loaded by `hyprland.lua`) instead of relying on the removed generator.
- `scripts/quickshell/settings/SettingsPopup.qml` -- replaced legacy `hyprctl dispatch` calls with `hyprctl eval`.
- `scripts/qs_manager.sh` -- workspace switching uses `hl.dsp.focus`/`hl.dsp.window.move` via `hyprctl eval`.
- `scripts/exit.sh` -- session exit uses `hyprctl eval 'hl.dispatch(hl.dsp.exit())'`.
- `scripts/quickshell/applauncher/appLauncher.qml` -- launching apps uses `hyprctl eval 'hl.dispatch(hl.dsp.exec_cmd(...))'` (the removed `hyprctl dispatch exec` failed silently).
- `config/hypridle/hypridle.conf` -- dpms commands use `hyprctl eval 'hl.dispatch(hl.dsp.dpms(...))'`.
- `install.sh` -- cleans up legacy config on install; runs Matugen through `matugen-apply.sh`.
- `config/matugen/config.toml` -- Hyprland template now outputs `matugen-colors.lua` instead of `colors.conf`.

### Fixed
- Refresh rate changes from the settings panel (gear) staying at 60Hz: `applyMonitors()` used the removed `hyprctl keyword monitor` and failed silently. Now applies 60Hz/144Hz correctly via the Lua API.
- Display scaling (SUPER+Z) not applying: a leftover `settings_watcher.sh` process from before the migration was regenerating old configs and reloading Hyprland, reverting the scale. The zombie process was removed.
- App launcher (SUPER+D) showing the menu but never launching apps: `hyprctl dispatch exec` no longer exists and failed silently. Fixed with the Lua exec dispatcher.
- hypridle display dpms off/on (dim/suspend path) failing silently due to legacy `hyprctl dispatch dpms` syntax.
- Workspace switching and session exit broken by legacy `hyprctl dispatch` syntax.
- Settings panel keybinds/startup editor writing to `settings.json` with no effect (the generator was removed): now generates Lua override modules that Hyprland loads.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `scripts/detect-monitors.sh` -- auto-detects all connected monitors and generates `config/monitors.conf` with each monitor set to its highest available refresh rate.
- `scripts/quickshell/quicknotes/QuickNotes.qml` -- lightweight text editor with auto-save, bound to SUPER+Y.
- `scripts/quickshell/system-monitor/SystemMonitor.qml` and `fetch.sh` -- CPU, RAM, disk, temperature, processes, uptime display, bound to SUPER+I.
- `scripts/quickshell/rss-reader/RssReader.qml` and `fetch.py`, `feeds.txt` -- RSS feed reader with per-source filtering, bound to SUPER+O.
- `scripts/quickshell/file-search/FileSearch.qml` and `fetch.sh` -- local file search via fd/find, opens with xdg-open, bound to SUPER+'.
- `scripts/quickshell/window-controls/WindowControls.qml` and `persist.sh` -- live window opacity, blur, and rounding sliders. Changes persist across Hyprland reloads via `config/window-effects.conf`. Bound to SUPER+SHIFT+B.
- `config/window-effects.conf` -- persisted decoration overrides, sourced at the end of `hyprland.conf` so it properly overrides defaults.

### Changed
- `hyprland.conf` -- replaced hardcoded `monitor = , preferred, auto, 1` with `source = ~/.config/hypr/config/monitors.conf`; added `source = ~/.config/hypr/config/window-effects.conf` at the end.
- `scripts/settings_watcher.sh` -- fallback path (no monitors in settings.json) calls `detect-monitors.sh` instead of `preferred`.
- `config/hypr/autostart.conf` -- added `exec-once` for detect-monitors.
- `install.sh` -- runs monitor detection after deploying dotfiles.
- `scripts/quickshell/applauncher/app_fetcher.py` -- complete rewrite: desktop ID blocklist, Hidden/NotShowIn support, extra search fields, icon validation via `BAD_ICONS` blacklist.
- `scripts/quickshell/applauncher/appLauncher.qml` -- fixed base64 key mismatch (echo -> printf); search now covers generic_name, comment, categories, keywords; letter fallback for missing icons.
- `scripts/quickshell/calendar/CalendarPopup.qml` -- removed duplicate horizontal centering that conflicted with WindowRegistry.js.
- `scripts/quickshell/WindowRegistry.js` -- registered all new widgets.
- `config/hypr/keybinds.conf` -- added shortcuts for all new widgets.
- `scripts/caching.sh` -- fixed invalid variable names when widget name contains hyphens.
- `scripts/quickshell/MatugenColors.qml` -- added terminal-style dynamic colors (color0 through color15, background, foreground) derived from the Matugen palette.
- `scripts/quickshell/TopBar.qml` -- added CPU/RAM pill in the system indicator bar; assigned distinct dynamic palette colors to each indicator (KB=color5, WiFi=color6, BT=color4, CPU/RAM=color1, Volume=color3).
- `install.sh` -- install_nvim_config now asks whether to use bundled config, clone xscriptor-colors/nvim, or skip; install_hack_nerd_font now copies font to /usr/share/fonts/ via sudo for SDDM.

### Fixed
- Monitor refresh rate resetting to 60Hz on systems that support higher rates. Root cause: `preferred` picks EDID default (60Hz) and `monitors.conf` was never sourced.
- App launcher usage tracking broken: `echo` added `\n` to base64 keys, preventing frequency sort from ever working.
- System Monitor widget not loading: hyphen in widget name broke caching.sh; inline QML `component` keyword not supported by Quickshell 0.3.
- Calendar popup not centered: QML was overriding X position set by WindowRegistry.js with a different scale calculation.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed
- Migrated `windowrules.conf` to Hyprland v0.53 syntax standards.
  - Replaced deprecated `windowrulev2` with `windowrule`.
  - Updated regex matching to use `match:field criteria` syntax.
  - Added explicit boolean values (e.g., `float 1`) to all rules.
